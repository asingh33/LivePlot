# LivePlot
https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/89076485

This is a python script to allow live plotting by reading the plotting data from a local file.

Usage:
This script reads from a local file and plots the contents using matplotlib python library.
In order to get live plotting just keep updating the local text file from your other script.

Sample:
I have used this script for my other project - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeeV5gr9tBw
